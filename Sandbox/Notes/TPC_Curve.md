# Thermal Performance Curve Notes
1. Why we need TPC in `physiology` and `ecology`?

    - TPC provide objective estimates of 'optimal' temperature (usually the temperature at which performance is maximal).
    
2. What `terms` do we have in TPC?

    1. **Performance breadth**
    2. **Tolerance Zone** (Critical Thermal Limits)
    3. **Optimum (Performence)**
        
        - Thermal Optimum $T_0$
    4. **x: Temperature**
    5. **y: Trait rates/values**

3. What properties do we have in TPC?

    - Single maximum point (Thermal optimum $T_0$)

    - Asymmetric skew towards `low body temperatures`

4. What `constraints` do we have on TPC functions?

    - Effects of temp on underlying `enzymatic reactions`

    - Some insects TPC predicted by `thermal kinetics of control enzymes`

5. Some hypothesis related to TPC:
    1. **Hotter-is-better Hypothesis**

        - Max performance of organisms with high opti. temp $>>$ that of organisms with low opti. temp

    2. **Jack-of-all-temperatures Hypothesis**

        - Trade-off exists between maximal performance and breath of performance

        - The trade-off >> compromise between `flexibility` and `stability` of enzymes.
