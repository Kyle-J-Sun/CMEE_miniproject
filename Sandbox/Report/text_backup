Body temperature plays an essential role of influence on 
ectotherm's performance, by affecting related metabolic 
traits rate (e.g. photosynthetic, respiration and growth 
rate). Higher temperature may have a stronger change in 
these metabolic rates, so that the performence of species 
may be maximized. Extreme temperature may also deteriorate 
their performence dramatically (Huey and Kingsolver, 1989) Therefore, research on 
the relationship between biological traits and body 
temperature has been becoming increasingly necessary. 
The introduction of Thermal Performence Curves, referred as 
TPC below, gives a neat solution to decribe the relationship quantitively because
of its three significant properites. Firstly, TPC has a single
maximum point (Thermal optimum $T_0$) can offer a point of 
estimated temperature where the organisms have a optimal 
performance. (Huey and Kingsolver, 1989) Secondly, TPC can provide a range of temperature
points that organisms performed well, referred to 'Performance breadth'. (Huey and Stevenson, 1979)
Finally, it can also give a range of temperature points where the species
have a diminished performance, known as â€œtolerance zone". (Huey and Kingsolver, 1989) 
Afterwards, in order to have a better study in this area, 
many authors also implemented numbers of models for 
catching the changing trends of the thermal 
performence curves.  However, fitting the models became a 
complicated thing since many models are too complex to fit
by hand. Hence, this problem causes the combination between
programming tools and modeling of the TPC.
